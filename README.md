### Sabito - Chat App  ⤵
 
Sabito is a realtime chat app, built with react, typescript, firebase and other technologies. My inspiration came from [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com/) and [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/). _Note: I need to add some tests before I'm finished. Therefore, the website is not available._
